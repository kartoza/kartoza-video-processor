# Prompt Log

## 2026-01-18

**Prompt:** using the folder above ../kartoza-timesheets-app, start a new github repo with all the niceties for ci, release creation, nix flakes, makefile, and a nice neat code base. The go app should reimplement the logic in /etc/xdg/hypr/scripts/screen-recorder.sh in neat modular go. Use the same design aesthetic, components etc. as used in the timesheet app

**Summary:** Create a new Go application (kartoza-video-processor) that reimplements the screen-recorder.sh bash script functionality. The application should:
1. Have CI/CD with GitHub Actions (ci.yml, release.yml)
2. Use Nix flakes for builds and dev environment
3. Include a comprehensive Makefile
4. Follow the same project structure as kartoza-timesheets-app
5. Use Bubble Tea for TUI
6. Use Cobra for CLI commands
7. Implement modular Go code for:
   - Monitor detection (hyprctl integration)
   - Screen recording (wl-screenrec)
   - Audio recording (pw-record)
   - Webcam recording (ffmpeg/v4l2)
   - Audio processing (noise reduction, normalization)
   - Video/audio merging (ffmpeg)
   - Desktop notifications

**Prompt:** have the same splash animation on start and exit

1. Entry splash: Logo expands from 5% to 100% with easeInOutCubic easing (3 seconds)
2. Exit splash: Logo shrinks from 100% to 5% with easeInOutCubic easing (2 seconds)
3. Support for Kitty graphics protocol with PNG logo
4. Fallback to ASCII art for non-Kitty terminals
